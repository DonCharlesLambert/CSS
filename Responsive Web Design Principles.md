# Responsive Web Design

## Media Queries

>@media(max-width: 100px){  
}

## Responsive Images
>img{  
  max-width: 100%;  
  height: auto;  
}  

height: auto; maintains the aspect ratio

## Retina Displays
On Macs and iPads
Make the image half the size
Further Research required

## Viewport Units
Based of the viewport size
* vw (viewport width)
* vh (viewport height)
* vmin (viewport minimum)
* vmax (viewport maximum)

10vw for example means 10% of viewport width
viewport minimum means whichever is smaller of height and width
These are different to percentages which are based off the parent container
